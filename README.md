# Greg Harris Art

This is the publically available code for http://www.gregharrisart.com .

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my coding profeciencies
and not so much be an open-source project that I look to have improved upon
or shared.

Greg Harris is a personal friend of mine and an artist. I offered to build
him a portfolio website to showcase his art.

# Zenphoto Image CMS
This site uses Zenphoto CMS so my friend can more easily upload photos
and attach metadata to them.

While I'm not a fan of the code styling used by the library, I am handicapped
by what I can build. I have limited access on my hosting plan so I can’t use
handy tools like Symfony or NPM – I can only run basic PHP scripts.
